This is a GstAVSynth port of the Yadif AviSynth filter.
It is based on original AviSynth Yadif v1.4.

GstAVSynth is available here:
http://github.com/LRN/gst-avsynth

Original Yadif for AviSynth is available here:
http://avisynth.org.ru/yadif/yadif.html

To use Yadif (after you compile it) you'll need GStreamer itself and
GstAVSynth GStreamer plugin.

Yadif should (in theory) work on all platforms where GStreamer works. Yadif
is tested and works on Windows.

To build Yadif, use GNU Make with one of the makefiles:
    make -f Makefile.something

For Windows builds there is a special batch file and a special makefile.
